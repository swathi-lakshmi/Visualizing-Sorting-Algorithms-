# Visualizing-Sorting-Algorithms
This project visualizes 8 sorting algorithms (namely, bubble sort, insertion sort, quick sort, selection sort, merge sort, heapify, shell sort and count sort) using Python. A Sorting Algorithm is used to rearrange a given array or list elements according to a comparison operator on the elements. Using this project, one can understand the concepts, codes, time complexities and the basic effectiveness of these algorithms, and, can learn and detect the comparisions between the same. 2 python libraries, 'random' and 'matplotlib', have been used in the code. 

The main objective of this project is to help the students and teachers to understand these data structures concepts easily, as it is proven that kinesthetic learning is more effective than plain verbal learning.
